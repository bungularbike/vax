					<h6>Preclinical</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>Establishing and upgrading your facilities makes research progress faster, but you'll also have to pay your researchers more every day.</li>
						<li>If you're low on money, run tests! The more progress you make between tests, the more funds you are awarded. Don't run tests too often (without making much progress) and don't run them too infrequently (to avoid running out of money by having to pay your researchers).</li>
						<li>Having more facilities increases the "bonus" rate at which codons which have been fully unlocked are automatically decoded for you.</li>
					</ul>
					<h6>Phase I</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>Running trials costs money, so don't feel a need to create and test as many candidates as you have the capability to.</li>
						<li>Pay attention to your trial results (logged in the event console). They will tell you which excipients are effective and which are not.</li>
						<li>Upgrading facilities allows them to run trials faster - but only if you do it before the trial starts!</li>
						<li>Watch your money carefully (phase I trials cost $500K to run) and try to avoid requesting funds as this decreases your WTC. Instead, run successful trials that make progress to be awarded funds!</li>
					</ul>
					<h6>Phases II & III</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>In addition to effectiveness, you want to make your vaccine as safe as possible. Countries will not want to grant you a license if your vaccine isn't safe!</li>
						<li>Even if your vaccine is already very safe (99%+), consider researching safety upgrades to boost your WTC with other countries.</li>
						<li>In Phase III, remember that you must finish your research before running trials or else the vaccine being used in the trials will not contain the upgrades!</li>
						<li>Clinical trials during these phases can be expensive, so you may not have enough money to conduct all the research and run all the trials simultaneously as you want. Make some progress first to gain funds, then improve your vaccine further!</li>
					</ul>
					<h6>Manufacturing & Distribution</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>It is recommended to vaccinate countries which you have facilities in first, because it will be easier for you to keep an eye on whether you're making a profit and whether you're manufacturing enough doses.</li>
						<li>If you don't have enough money to make doses then manufacturing will pause. However, deliveries don't pause until you completely run out of doses!</li>
						<li>As countries become more vaccinated and are eventually declared virus-free, their demand for doses will decrease. Keep this in mind and scale down manufacturing accordingly.</li>
					</ul>
